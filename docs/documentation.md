Documentation
===========================

The documentation system uses Python-based Sphinx to build a static HTML website from the ReST and Markdown formatted source files in the `/docs` folder. This build is executed automatically via GitHub Actions when commits to the `master` branch are pushed. This system is based on [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64311970). 

The generated docs are available at [the GitHub Pages site](https://lsst-dm.github.io/lsst-sandbox/index.html).
